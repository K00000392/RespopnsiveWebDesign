   <div> <p> Any artist in the world can buy the new pink - except the prominent British Indian sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor. <br><br> Earlier this year Kapoor bought the rights to the world’s blackest black, a monopoly that has clearly angered the fabricator of a new pink paint.
British artist Stuart Semple has created what he claims to be the world’s pinkest pigment. Semple is selling PINK for just £3.99  (AUD 6.40) to all – except Kapoor. He said in a statement: ‘Anish can have his black. But the rest of us will be playing with the rainbow!’<br><br>
Purchasers of PINK will be required to make a legal declaration during the online checkout process, confirming that: ‘you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are not purchasing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this paint will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.’<br><br>
The anti-Kapoor campaign is a response a story in March this year, when Anish Kapoor bought the exclusive rights to the world’s blackest black, developed by NanoSystems. Vantablack is composed of a series of microscopic vertical tubes, and absorbs 99.98 per cent of light.<br><br>
Semple is one of the YBA artists, perhaps best known for his HappyCloud performance from Tate Modern, where he flooded the London skyline with pink smiley soap clouds.
