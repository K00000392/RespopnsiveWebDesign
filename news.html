         <h2>Artist bans Anish Kapoor from world’s hottest pink
            </h2>
            <p>Any artist in the world can buy the new pink - except the prominent British Indian sculptor Sir Anish Kapoor. 

                Earlier this year Kapoor bought the rights to the world’s blackest black, a monopoly that has clearly angered the fabricator of a new pink paint. British artist Stuart Semple has created what he claims to be the world’s pinkest pigment. Semple is selling PINK for just £3.99  (AUD 6.40) to all – except Kapoor. He said in a statement: ‘Anish can have his black. But the rest of us will be playing with the rainbow!’</p>

         <h2>Fernard Leger's Birthday</h2>
            <p>The French artist Fernand Léger’s name might not be the first that comes to mind when thinking about Cubists or Dadaists, yet he was a central figure in exploring the boundaries of these movements throughout his fruitful and ever-evolving practice. His fresh approach made it possible for him to become a bridge between what was going on in his time and what was about to come.</p>

‘Our role is to make it all happen’, says project architect Jernej Cencic. While Aristotle’s claim that architects are ‘more estimable and know more and are wiser than the artisans, because they know the reasons of the things which are done’ sounds very prejudiced, what is true is that the architect, jumping from project to project, never acquires the level of expertise of the craftsmen he collaborates with.</p>
